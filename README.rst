Django-Dipper
=============

Why another form rendering library for Django? Well, django-dipper is built with a few core principles that
are not yet represented (at the same time) in any package that we're aware of. Namely:

* Form rendering should be handled entirely in the template.
* Custom form rendering should be prioritized over form layouts.
* Subclassing django forms should not be required.
* Both Jinja and Django templates should be supported out of the box.
* Python 2 and Python 3 should be supported out of the box.
